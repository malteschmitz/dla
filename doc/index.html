    <blockquote>
      Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles
      undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to
      form aggregates of such particles. This theory, proposed by Witten
      and Sander in 1981, is applicable to aggregation in any system where
      diffusion is the primary means of transport in the system. DLA can be
      observed in many systems such as electrodeposition, Hele-Shaw flow,
      mineral deposits, and dielectric breakdown.

    <p>This JavaScript application is a computer simulation of DLA.
    <a href="..">Try it now.</a></p>    
    
    <h2>basic idea</h2>
    
    <p>We always start with a seed in the center of a grid. New particles
    start diffusing at a random position on
    a circle with fixed radius which is part of the grid.
    This circle is simulating the infinity. There is only one particle
    at a time diffusing. If this particle leaves the grid a new one starts
    at another random position. The particle attaches to the existing particles
    if it reaches a position with at least one particle in the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood">Von Neumann
    neighborhood</a>. This way a DLA cluster growths starting at the initial
    seed. Once a diffusing particle sticks to another particle at a position on
    the circle no new particles gets created. If the cluster has reached
    the circle the approximation of the circle to simulate infinity does
    no more hold at all.</p>
    
    <p>A particle diffuses by drawing two random numbers
    <em>&delta;<sub>x</sub></em> and <em>&delta;<sub>y</sub></em> out of
    {&minus;1, 0, 1} and
    adding the vector (<em>&delta;<sub>x</sub></em>,
    <em>&delta;<sub>y</sub></em>) to
    the current position (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>). This way the particle
    moves into one of the eight possible directions up, up right, right, down
    right, down, down left, left, up left or stays at its position with
    equal probability.</p>
    
    <h3>Variants</h3>
    
    <p>In this one-grain version you can set the
    probability that a new particle sticks to an existing particle. If at
    least one particle exists in the Von Neumann
    neighborhood the current particle sticks to them with this probability.
    If it does not stick it continues diffusing but avoids positions which
    already contains any particle.</p>
    
    <p>In the two-grain version there are two different types of particles,
    named 2 and 3, which are generated alternating. We always start with
    a particle 2 in the center of the grid. Two particles have (depending on
    whom to attach) a sticking probability given by the following matrix.</p>
    <p><img src="../two-grain.png" width="84" height="44" alt="(1,a;b,1-c)"></p>
    <ul>
     <li>Two particles of type 2 stick together with probability 1.</li>
     <li>If a diffusing particle of type 2 hits a particle of type 3 it
       gets attached with probability <em>a</em>.</li>
     <li>If a diffusing particle of type 3 hits a particle of type 2 it
       gets attached with probability <em>b</em>.</li>
     <li>Two particles of type 3 stick together with probability
       1 &minus; <em>c</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As sticking probability the sum of all these probabilities for the
    particles in the Von Neumann neighborhood of the diffusing particle
    is used.</p>
    
    <h2>rendered images</h2>
    <p>All images are generated with dimension 600&times;600 and a circle with radius 240.</p>
    <h3>one-grain version</h3>
    <p>With a sticking probability of 1 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="one-grain-1.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="one-grain with probability 1"></p>
    <p>With a sticking probability of 0.5 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="one-grain-05.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="one-grain with probability 0.5"></p>
    <p>With a sticking probability of 0.1 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="one-grain-01.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="one-grain with probability 0.1"></p>
    <p>One can observe that the branches of the cluster consists of
    more particles the lower the sticking probability is. This can be
    explained by watching the movement of one particle: It starts on
    the circle and hits one of the outer particles of the cluster first.
    With high sticking probability it attaches to one of the outer
    particles of the cluster. With a lower sticking probability the
    diffusing particle does not attach to the first particle it hits and thus
    can diffuse deeper into the cluster.</p>
    
    <h3>two-grain with <em>a</em> = <em>b</em></h3>    
    <p>With sticking probabilities of <em>a</em> = 0.1, <em>b</em> = 0.1 and <em>c</em> = 0.1 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="two-grain-a01b01c01.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="two-grain with probabilities a = 0.1, b = 0.1 and c = 0.1"></p>
    <p>With sticking probabilities of <em>a</em> = 0.1, <em>b</em> = 0.1 and <em>c</em> = 0.5 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="two-grain-a01b01c05.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="two-grain with probabilities a = 0.1, b = 0.1 and c = 0.5"></p>
    <p>With sticking probabilities of <em>a</em> = 0.1, <em>b</em> = 0.1 and <em>c</em> = 0.9</h2> we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="two-grain-a01b01c09.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="two-grain with probabilities a = 0.1, b = 0.1 and c = 0.9"></p>
    <p>With increasing <em>c</em> one can observe the same behaviour as with
    decreasing sticking probability in the one-grain-version. Additionally one
    can observe that with increasing <em>c</em> more type 3 particles&mdash;the blue
    ones&mdash;gets attaches to the type 2 particles&mdash;the lime ones.
    The type 2 particles form long branches whereas the type 3 particles
    gets attaches to any other particles and from random dot clouds.</p>
    
    <h3>two-grain version with <em>a</em> &ne; <em>b</em></h3>
    <p>With sticking probabilities of <em>a</em> = 0.9, <em>b</em> = 0.1 and <em>c</em> = 0.1 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="two-grain-a09b01c01.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="two-grain with probabilities a = 0.9, b = 0.1 and c = 0.1"></p>
    <p>In this picture type 2 particles&mdash;the lime ones&mdash;gets
    attached to any existing particle with high probability.</p>
    <p>With sticking probabilities of <em>a</em> = 0.1, <em>b</em> = 0.9 and <em>c</em> = 0.1 we get the following cluster.</p>
    <p><img src="two-grain-a01b09c01.png" class="canvas" width="600" height="600" alt="two-grain with probabilities a = 0.1, b = 0.9 and c = 0.1"></p>
    <p>In this picture type 3 particles&mdash;the blue ones&mdash;gets
    attached to any existing particle with high probability. Therefore the type
    3 particles should form longer branches, but I am not able to see that
    difference.</p>
    
    <h2>technical details</h2>
    
    <p>The function <code>readOptions</code> gets called every time the
    start button is pressed. It uses <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
    to read the options edited in the HTML input fields and sets variables
    declared at the beginning of the script.</p>
    
    <p>As drawing surface the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial">HTML5 canvas element</a>
    is used. The function
    <code>clearCanvas</code> gets called every time the start
    button is pressed. First it sets the dimension of the canvas according
    to the given width, height and zoom factor. The zoom is achieved simply
    by the difference of the width and height attributes of the canvas element
    and the width and height set to the canvas element via
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>.
    Once the canvas has the correct size it gets cleared using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/CanvasRenderingContext2D#clearRect()">clearRect</a>
    and the circle is drawn using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/CanvasRenderingContext2D#arc()">arc</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The function <code>drawPoint</code> draws a particle with type of the
    given value at the given position in the canvas. The type value gets
    transformed into the corresponding color and the pixel gets painted on the
    canvas using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/CanvasRenderingContext2D#fillRect()">fillRect</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The current state of the grid is internally stored in the variable
    <code>grid</code>. This variable is a JavaScript object and is indexed
    via <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> &middot; <em>width</em>. A JavaScript objects
    works roughly like a hash map, so storing spare matrices like this grid
    is more efficient than using real arrays. (JavaScript does not have
    real arrays anyway.)</p>
    
    <p>The function <code>addPoint</code> takes the coordinates of a point and
    a value and adds this point to <code>grid</code>, calls
    <code>drawPoint</code> and adds the point to the list
    <code>oldPoints</code>. In this list a fixed number of last points is kept.
    These are the highlighted points and the list is used to remove the
    highlighting from the canvas for every point that leaves the queue.</p>
    
    <p>The function <code>computeStartPoint</code> returns a random start point
    somewhere on the circle. This point gets computed using a random number
    &alpha; out of the range [0, 2&pi;) and evaluating
    <em>x</em> = radius &middot; cos(&alpha;) and <em>y</em> = radius &middot;
    sin(&alpha;).</p>
    
    <p>The function <code>computePoint</code> computes a start point with
    the above function and lets it diffuse. If the particle moves out
    of the grid, the inner loop ends and the outer loop starts another
    run with a new start point. If a position with particles in the
    neighborhood is reached the function returns the current position
    if a random number out of [0,1) is lower than the specified
    stickiness.</p>
    
    <p>The function <code>computePointTwo</code> works analogue to
    <code>computePoint</code> but using <code>computeProp</code>
    to get the sticking probability. The function
    <code>computeProp</code> takes the value of the diffusing particle
    and the value of the neighbor particle and returns the stickiness
    probability. The returned value for all neighbor particles get added
    together and if a random number out of [0,1) is lower than the stickiness
    computed this way the function returns the current position.</p>
    
    <p>The functions <code>step</code> and <code>stepTwo</code> are calling
    <code>computePoint</code> or <code>computePointTwo</code>
    and <code>addPoint</code> to perform one step. This function is not called
    in a loop but calling itself using
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout">window.setTimeout</a>.
    This way the browsers gets back control after every particle added to the
    clister and the user can see the cluster growing while it gets computed.</p>
    
    <p>Finally the function <code>start</code> calls
    the setup functions to initialize the canvas and the <code>grid</code>
    and places the initial seed. Then it starts the first <code>step</code>.</p>
